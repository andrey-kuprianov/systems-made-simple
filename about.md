Hi there! My name is Andrey Kuprianov, and over a number of years I observed (and in some cases helped to build) software systems that suffered from design flaws, leading to these systems being fragile, unreliable, or even insecure. From my work experience, and from my experience in developing formal methods techniques, I have a number ideas on how the software systems can be improved; this is the website where I intend to verbalize my ideas in a series of blog posts. 

Meet _Systems Made Simple_, a blog about simplifying software systems, (non-)accidentally sharing its acronym with _SMS_ (Short Message Service): a _simple_ messaging system from the epoch of the first mobile phones (the first SMS message was sent on 3 December 1992), but which is still the most widely used data application. My hope is that this success story can be applied and generalized to other software systems.
