_Solarkraft has been developed in collaboration by [Igor Konnov][], [Jure Kukovec][], [Andrey Kuprianov][] and [Thomas Pani][]._

_This is the fifth and last in a series of blog posts introducing [Solarkraft][], a TLA+-based runtime monitoring solution for [Soroban smart contracts][Soroban]. The first post,_ ["A New Hope â€“ Why Smart Contract Bugs Matter and How Runtime Monitoring Saves the Day"][part1] _gives an overview of smart contracts, explains how traditional security fails to address major challenges in securing crypto assets, and introduces runtime monitoring as a solution. The second post,_ ["Guardians of the Blockchain: Small and Modular Runtime Monitors in TLA+ for Soroban Smart Contracts"][part2] _introduces the language of Solarkraft monitors. The third post,_ ["How to Run Solarkraft"][part3] _gives an overview of the various features of Solarkraft, and explains how to use each one, step-by-step. The forth post, _ ["The Force Awakens: Hybrid Blockchain Runtime Monitors"][part4] _explores the distinctions between direct and reverse blockchain monitors._

In this post we first formally define what are hybrid blockchain runtime monitors (from the formal methods point of view), as then proceed to explore the far-reaching avenues of how to go from _offline monitoring_, as done now in Solarkraft, to truly _online monitoring_ on the live blockchain.


## Verifying Blockchain Monitors

All that is nice and good, but there are a few questions that still need to be addressed, as people with different backgrounds might feel:

- A formal methods person: "How do you _verify_ monitor specs? What are your verification conditions?"
- A math person: "What about verification _complexity_?"
- A software engineering person: "How do you _practically check_ them on the live blockchain?"

This section outlines the answers to the above questions. TL;DR; for those who are not interested in these details:

- We verify monitor specs via a) producing verification conditions from each monitor specification; b) extracting transactions from the blockchain; c) validating each transaction against verification conditions using the Apalache model checker.
- Complexity of verifying monitor specs is _linear_ wrt. the number of conditions in the specification, and the number of transactions: each condition is checked _at most once_ against every transaction (but many checks may be skipped/optimized away).
- Practically, we integrate monitor specs as outlined here in the `solarcraft verify` command; the documentation for which can be found elsewhere in this repo. `Solarcraft` is a tool that we write specifically for checking monitor specifications against blockchain transactions. Currently we are doing it in _offline mode_ by first downloading transactions using `solarcraft fetch`, and then verifying them; eventually we want to move into verifying monitor specs on the live blockchain, i.e. we want to do _online monitoring_.

## Blockchain Runtime Monitors in Formal Attire ðŸ‘”

Formally, a blockchain is a sequence of _ledgers_, where each ledger is a snapshot of the blockchain _state_. States are partitioned: first into separate spaces per contract, and then into separate regions per contract variable. 

Blockchain states are mutated by _transactions_, where each transaction is an invocation of a certain contract _method_ with the corresponding method parameters supplied. The invoked method modifies the states according to its logic.

For our purposes we consider only the state as it's relevant for a single contract and its variables. Thus we will use the following notations:

- $$D$$ is the set of all possible data values: strings, numbers, structs, etc. Mathematically we don't distinguish between different data types (though practically we of course do).
- $$V$$ is the set of typed contract variables. At this stage we don't distinguish between states of different contracts: logical assertions may refer to the state of any contract (e.g. to token balances in other contracts).
- $$S = S_0, S_1, ...$$ is the sequence of states.
- $$S_i \subseteq V \rightarrow D$$ is the $$i$$-th contract state, which is a partial mapping from variables to their data values. If a variable $$v$$ is present in the mapping $$S_i$$, we say that it _exists_ in this state.
- $$T = T_0, T_1, ...$$ is the sequence of transactions. Each transaction brings the contract into its next state, which we denote by $$S_i \xrightarrow{T_i} S_{i+1}$$.
- $$P_T$$ is the set of all possible typed method parameters.
- $$T_i \subseteq P_T \rightarrow D$$: each transaction is a method invocation, represented by a partial mapping from method parameter names to their values; only the parameters specific to the invoked method are present in the mapping.
- $$E = E_0, E_1, ...$$ is the blockchain environment, which is a sequence of environment states; each transaction executes in a specific environment state.
- $$P_E$$ is the set of all typed environment parameters (such as `current_contract_address`, `ledger_timestamp`, or `method_name`).
- $$E_i = P_E \rightarrow D$$ is a mapping from environment parameters to their values, and defines the current blockchain environment, in which $$T_i$$ executes.
- $$X_i \in \mathbb{B} = \{ \top, \bot \}$$ is the result of executing the transaction $$T_i$$: $$\top$$ in case of success, $$\bot$$ in case of failure.

The above definitions describe the structure of the object to which we apply monitor specifications: a smart contract, executing on a blockchain. Now it's time to define the structure of monitor specifications themselves. As checking each direct method specification or reverse effect specification is independent from others, we define only the structure for individual monitors.

- $$M_D = \langle F, P, H \rangle$$ is a direct method monitor specification, where the components are the finite sets of `MustFail`, `MustPass`, and `MustHold` conditions respectively.
- $$M_R = \langle C, A \rangle$$ is a reverse effect monitor specification, where the components are the finite sets of `MonitorCheck` and `MonitorAssert` conditions respectively.

In the above:

- For any $$F_j \in F$$, $$P_k \in P$$ we have $$F_j, P_k \subseteq (E_i, S_i, T_i) \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$$ are boolean conditions of the environment state, the past contract state, and the method parameters.
-  For any $$H_j \in H$$ we have $$H_j \subseteq (E_i, S_i, T_i) \times S_{i+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$$ are boolean conditions of the environment state, the past contract state, the method parameters, and the next contract state.
- For any $$C_j \in C$$, $$A_k \in A$$ we have $$C_j, A_k \subseteq (E_i, S_i) \times S_{i+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$$ are boolean conditions defined over the environment state, the past contract state, and the next contract state.

### Verification Conditions for Blockchain Monitors

Now we are in a position to formally specify verification conditions for blockchain monitors.

**For a direct blockchain monitor** $$M_D = \langle F, P, H \rangle$$, we combine individual monitor conditions into larger ones:

$$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Fail}} = \bigvee_{j}{F_j}$$

$$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Pass}} = \bigvee_{j}{P_j}$$

$$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Hold}} = \bigwedge_{j}{H_j}$$

Given the above combined conditions, we check these verification conditions:

| Name | Verification condition |
| -----| ---------------------- |
| Must fail | $$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Fail}}  \implies X_i = \bot$$ |
| Failure completeness | $$X_i = \bot \implies \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Fail}}$$ |
| Must succeed | $$\neg \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Fail}} \wedge \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Pass}} \implies X_i = \top$$ |
| Success completeness | $$X_i = \top \implies \neg \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Fail}} \wedge \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Pass}}$$ |
| Method correctness  | $$X_i = \top \implies \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Hold}}$$ |

Please feel free to contrast these formal verification conditions with the [informal conditions from the previous post][part4directmonitors]. Notice also that the two implications from the pairs "Must fail"/"Failure completeness" and "Must succeed"/"Success completeness" encode together an equivalence between the checks and the transaction execution result. Nevertheless, we consider it a better strategy to treat these conditions separately, as this allows the developers to encode a more fine-grained monitor response. For example, a monitor may forcefully revert a transaction that violates the "Must fail" condition, but only issue a warning when "Failure completeness" is violated.

**For a reverse blockchain monitor** $$M_R = \langle C, A \rangle$$, we also combine individual monitor conditions into larger ones:

$$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Check}} = \bigvee_{j}{C_j}$$

$$\mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Assert}} = \bigwedge_{j}{A_j}$$

Reverse monitors encode only a single verification condition:

| Name | Verification condition |
| -----| ---------------------- |
| Effect correctness | $$X_i = \top \wedge \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Check}} \implies \mathbb{C}_{\mathit{Assert}}$$ |

### Practical checking of monitor specifications

In the present [Solarkraft system][Solarkraft] we do what's called _offline monitoring_: we verify monitors _after_ the state has already been committed to the blockchain. Our eventual goal is to perform _online monitoring_, i.e. to verify the monitors _before_ the state has been committed, in order to be able to do preventive actions. This far-reaching goal is non-trivial, and has a few intermediate-strength solutions, which we are about to explore now.
